\section{Black Beans and Pickled Onions} % Title of the Section
A tasty and simple large meal. Fantastic for meal preps.

\textbf{\large{\emph{Preliminaries:}}}

The night before cooking, begin soaking the beans in a large bowl. This makes the beans more digestible by washing out indigestible starches\footfullcite{Silva_1982}.

Chop one red onion vertically and toss in ~1/3 cup of rice wine vinegar, a pinch of salt, and sugar until the solution is just saturated.

\textbf{Procedure:}

Dice white onion, bell pepper, and jalepeños. Sweat in a pan for ~10 minutes.

Add soaked beans and cover with water or stock. Grind in black pepper then add oregano and ground cumin.
Add 2 tablespoons of molasses or sugar. Cook until slightly past desired texture, as the beans will firm up as they cool.

Begin cooking brown rice at least one hour before beans finish.

Before serving, chop in ~1/2 bunch of coriander add rice wine vinegar, lime juice and salt to taste.
